# Recipe Project | Backend API
<b>Contributors</b>: Andrew Heckman, Jon Parker Brooks

## Dependencies
- Python3.10
- SQLite3 (included with python)
- Flask 2.2

## Testing
In order to get going quickly in the frontend with some sample data, run `python3 ./test/gendb.py` before running the server

## How To Use
In order to run the server you must have flask installed: 
`python3 -m pip install --user flask==2.2.2`. If flask is installed, 
you may run the program like so: `python3 -m flask --app ./src/main.py run`
